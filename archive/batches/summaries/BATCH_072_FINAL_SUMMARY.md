- ✅ **Weapon Setup Recommendations**: Recommend weapons based on build data
- ✅ **Budget-Aware Selection**: Choose appropriate templates within budget constraints
- ✅ **Stat Bonus Calculation**: Calculate total expected improvements

### 4. **Build Integration**
- ✅ **Batch 070 Integration**: Connect with build awareness system for profession-specific recommendations
- ✅ **Batch 071 Integration**: Integrate with stat optimizer for comprehensive analysis
- ✅ **Build Compatibility Validation**: Validate stats against build requirements
- ✅ **Profession-Specific Recommendations**: Tailor suggestions to specific professions
