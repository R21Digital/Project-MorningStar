## Key Features Implemented

### 1. PvP Risk Detection
- **TEF Flag Detection**: Detects Temporary Enemy Flags on nearby players
- **Duel Invite Monitoring**: Tracks duel invitations from other players
- **Overt Player Detection**: Identifies PvP-flagged players with configurable avoidance
- **GCW Hotspot Recognition**: Recognizes known PvP zones with risk assessment
- **Faction Mix Analysis**: Analyzes nearby player faction distribution for risk assessment

### 2. Risk Assessment System
- **Dynamic Risk Scoring**: Calculates real-time risk scores based on multiple factors
- **Time-based Decay**: Risk scores decay over time to reflect changing situations
- **Distance Weighting**: Closer players have higher risk impact
- **Faction Multipliers**: Different factions can have different risk weights
- **Zone-based Risk**: GCW zones have additional risk multipliers

### 3. Avoidance Strategies
- **Soft Path Deviation**: Minor course corrections for low risk
- **Mount Escape**: Rapid escape using vehicles for medium-high risk
- **Safe Spot Wait**: Moving to designated safe areas
- **Zone Change**: Complete zone evacuation for high risk
- **Session Pause**: Emergency logout for critical situations
- **Log Only**: Passive monitoring without action

### 4. Policy Configuration
```json
{
  "avoid_overt": true,
  "evade_threshold": 0.7,
  "log_only": false,
  "safe_spot_radius": 60,

## Technical Architecture

### Core Classes

#### PvPWatchdog
Main system class that orchestrates all PvP detection and avoidance functionality.

**Key Methods:**
- `detect_tef_flag()` - Detect TEF flags on players
- `detect_duel_invite()` - Handle duel invitations
- `detect_overt_player()` - Detect PvP-flagged players
- `assess_zone_risk()` - Evaluate zone-based risks
- `calculate_risk_score()` - Compute overall risk score
- `get_avoidance_strategy()` - Determine appropriate response
- `execute_avoidance_strategy()` - Execute chosen strategy

#### Data Models
- **PvPPlayer**: Represents detected PvP players with risk information
- **PvPZone**: Represents risk zones with threat assessment
- **PvPEvent**: Logs PvP-related events for analysis
- **PvPPolicy**: Configuration for avoidance behavior

#### Enums
- **PvPRiskType**: TEF_FLAG, DUEL_INVITE, OVERT_PLAYER, GCW_HOTSPOT, etc.
- **RiskLevel**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
- **AvoidanceStrategy**: SOFT_PATH_DEVIATION, MOUNT_ESCAPE, etc.

### Risk Calculation Algorithm

1. **Player-based Risk**: Sum of individual player threat scores with distance decay
2. **Zone-based Risk**: Zone threat score based on player count and faction mix
3. **Combined Risk**: Weighted combination (70% players, 30% zones)
4. **Policy Adjustments**: Apply configuration multipliers and thresholds
5. **Time Decay**: Reduce risk over time for stale detections

### Threat Score Calculation

```python
base_score = risk_type_base_scores[risk_type]
distance_modifier = max(0.1, 1.0 - (distance / 100.0))
level_modifier = risk_level_modifiers[risk_level]
threat_score = base_score * distance_modifier * level_modifier
```
