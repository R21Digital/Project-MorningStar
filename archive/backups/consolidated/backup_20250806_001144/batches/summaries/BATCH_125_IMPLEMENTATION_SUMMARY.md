    "weapons": [{"name": "T-21 Rifle", "damage_type": "kinetic"}],
    "build_summary": "Optimized rifleman build for PvE content",
    "performance_metrics": {"pve_rating": 8.5},
    "tags": ["pve", "rifleman"],
    "visibility": "public",
    "rankings": ["top_dps"],
    "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00",

build_id = browser.publish_build(build_data)
print(f"Build published with ID: {build_id}")
```

### Searching Builds

```python
# Search by profession
rifleman_builds = browser.search_builds(profession="rifleman")

# Search by faction
rebel_builds = browser.search_builds(faction="rebel")

# Search by performance
top_builds = browser.get_top_builds(BuildRanking.TOP_DPS)

# Complex search
pve_rifleman_builds = browser.search_builds(
    profession="rifleman",
    pve_pvp="pve",
    min_gcw_rank=10
)
```
