### 4. Integration with MS11 Sessions

#### Automatic Scanning
The scanner can be integrated into MS11 sessions for automatic player detection:

```python
# In session manager or main loop
def session_loop():
    while True:
        # Get current location
        current_location = get_current_location()
        
        # Scan for players
        encounters = player_scanner.scan_for_players(current_location)
        
        # Process encounters
        for encounter in encounters:
            print(f"Detected {encounter.player_name} in {encounter.city}, {encounter.planet}")
        
        time.sleep(30)  # Scan every 30 seconds
```

#### Session Manager Integration
The scanner integrates with the existing session manager:

```python
from core.session_manager import SessionManager

session = SessionManager("quest")

# Record player encounter (compatible with existing system)
session.record_player_encounter(
    player_name="JediMaster",
    location="Naboo - Theed",
    distance=50.0,
    interaction_type="detected"
)
```
