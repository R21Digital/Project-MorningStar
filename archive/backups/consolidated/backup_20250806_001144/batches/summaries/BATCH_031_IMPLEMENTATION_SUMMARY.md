# Batch 031 Implementation Summary
## Mount Detection & Mount-Up Logic

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

### Overview
Batch 031 implements a comprehensive mount detection and automatic mounting system for MS11. The system allows the bot to identify available mounts using OCR, automatically mount for long-distance travel, and provides fallback support for manual mount commands.

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. OCR-Based Mount Detection
- **Hotbar Scanning**: Detects "Call Mount" buttons in multiple hotbar regions
- **Command Detection**: Scans chat/command history for mount commands
- **Mount Type Recognition**: Identifies specific mount types (AV-21, swoop, speederbike, etc.)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for detection accuracy

#### 2. Auto-Mount Logic
- **Distance-Based Triggering**: Automatically mounts when travel distance > 100m (configurable)
- **Zone-Aware Mounting**: Respects zone restrictions (indoor, city, combat zones)
- **Best Mount Selection**: Chooses the fastest suitable mount for the current situation
- **Fallback Support**: Falls back to alternative mounts if primary mount unavailable

#### 3. Mount Management
- **Mount Information Tracking**: Stores mount properties (speed, restrictions, learned status)
- **Mount Status Monitoring**: Tracks current mount state and availability
- **Mount History**: Records detection attempts and mount usage statistics

#### 4. Configuration System
- **Auto-Mount Toggle**: `auto_mount = true` setting as requested
- **Distance Threshold**: Configurable minimum distance for auto-mounting
- **Detection Intervals**: Configurable scan frequency
- **Zone Restrictions**: Comprehensive zone-based mount restrictions

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
1. **`movement/mount_handler.py`** - Core mount detection and management system
2. **`data/mounts.yaml`** - Comprehensive mount configuration and data

#### Demo Files
3. **`demo_batch_031_mount_handler.py`** - Demonstration script showing all functionality

### Technical Implementation

#### Mount Handler Architecture
```python
class MountHandler:
    """Mount detection and auto-mount system."""
    
    def __init__(self, config_path: str = "data/mounts.yaml"):
        # Initialize OCR engine, load configuration, set up detection keywords
        
    def detect_mounts(self) -> MountDetectionResult:
        # OCR-based mount detection from hotbar and commands
        
    def should_auto_mount(self, travel_distance: float, zone_name: str = None) -> bool:
        # Determine if auto-mount should be used
        
    def auto_mount_for_travel(self, travel_distance: float, zone_name: str = None) -> bool:
        # Automatically mount for long-distance travel
        
    def mount_creature(self, mount_name: str = None) -> bool:
        # Mount specific creature or best available mount
```

#### Data Structures
```python
@dataclass
class MountInfo:
    name: str
    mount_type: MountType
    speed: float
    indoor_allowed: bool
    city_allowed: bool
    combat_allowed: bool
    learned: bool = False
    hotbar_slot: Optional[int] = None
    command: Optional[str] = None

@dataclass
class MountDetectionResult:
    mounts_found: List[str]
    hotbar_mounts: List[str]
    command_mounts: List[str]
    detection_time: float
    confidence: float
```

#### Mount Types Supported
- **Speederbike** (2.0x speed) - Fast and agile
- **Swoop** (2.5x speed) - High-speed racing mount
- **AV-21** (3.0x speed) - Advanced speeder with enhanced capabilities
- **Dewback** (1.5x speed) - Reliable desert mount
- **Speeder** (1.8x speed) - Standard speeder vehicle
- **Bantha** (1.2x speed) - Large desert creature
- **Ronto** (1.3x speed) - Sturdy desert creature

### Configuration Features

#### Auto-Mount Settings
```yaml
config:
  auto_mount: true
  auto_mount_distance: 100  # meters
  detection_interval: 30    # seconds
  mount_check_interval: 10  # seconds
```

#### Zone Restrictions
- **Indoor zones**: No mounts allowed
- **City zones**: Most mounts allowed
- **Combat zones**: No mounts allowed
- **Outdoor zones**: All mounts allowed

#### Detection Keywords
- **Call mount**: "call mount", "mount", "summon mount"
- **Mount types**: Specific keywords for each mount type
- **Command patterns**: Regex patterns for command detection

### OCR Integration

#### Hotbar Scan Regions
```python
hotbar_regions = [
    (100, 500, 800, 600),   # Bottom hotbar
    (100, 450, 800, 550),   # Secondary hotbar
    (50, 400, 850, 500),    # Extended hotbar
]
```

#### Detection Keywords
```python
mount_keywords = {
    "call_mount": ["call mount", "mount", "summon mount"],
    "mount_types": {
        MountType.SPEEDERBIKE: ["speederbike", "speed bike", "bike"],
        MountType.AV21: ["av21", "av-21", "av 21"],
        MountType.SWOOP: ["swoop", "swoop bike"],
        # ... more mount types
    }
}
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Mount Detection
```python
from movement.mount_handler import get_mount_handler

handler = get_mount_handler()
detection_result = handler.detect_mounts()

print(f"Found {len(detection_result.mounts_found)} mounts")
print(f"Confidence: {detection_result.confidence:.1f}%")
```

#### Auto-Mount for Travel
```python
# Auto-mount for 200m travel in desert
success = handler.auto_mount_for_travel(200, "tatooine_desert")
if success:
    print("✅ Auto-mount successful")
```

#### Manual Mount Selection
```python
# Mount specific creature
success = handler.mount_creature("Speederbike")

# Mount best available
success = handler.mount_creature()
```
