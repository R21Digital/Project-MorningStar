# Batch 122 – Stat Scanner + Attribute Parser
## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive stat scanning and attribute parsing system that extracts character stats using OCR and macro commands, normalizes the data, uploads it to SWGDB player profiles, and establishes baselines for stat-based optimization used in later batches.

### Goals Achieved ✅

#### 1. OCR and Macro Scan /stats and /armor Panels
- **OCR-Based Extraction**: Comprehensive OCR scanning of game panels with confidence scoring and multiple preprocessing methods
- **Macro Command Integration**: Direct execution of `/stats` and `/armor` commands with output parsing
- **Multi-Source Data Collection**: Combines OCR panel scanning, macro command execution, and character sheet analysis
- **Panel Region Detection**: Configurable regions for different stat panels (stats_panel, armor_panel, character_sheet)
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for each extraction method with fallback options

#### 2. Normalize Stats: Health, Action, Mind, Luck, Resists, Tapes
- **Comprehensive Stat Types**: Support for all major character stats including Health, Action, Mind, Luck, and all resistance/tape types
- **Data Normalization**: Consistent data structure with current/max values, percentages, and confidence scores
- **Stat Validation**: Built-in validation for stat consistency and reasonable value ranges
- **Confidence Scoring**: OCR confidence tracking for data quality assessment
- **Source Tracking**: Tracks data source (OCR, macro, panel type) for debugging and optimization

#### 3. Upload Stat Data to SWGDB Player Profile
- **SWGDB API Integration**: Complete API client for uploading character stat data with authentication and retry logic
- **Batch Upload Support**: Efficient batch uploading of multiple character profiles
- **Optimization Profile Upload**: Separate API endpoints for optimization profiles and recommendations
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting and queue management for API requests
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms and detailed error reporting

#### 4. Begin Baseline for Stat-Based Optimization
- **Baseline Establishment**: Create and store baseline character profiles for progress tracking
- **Optimization Analysis**: Profession-specific optimization targets and gap analysis
- **Progress Tracking**: Compare current stats with baselines to measure improvements
- **Recommendation Engine**: Generate specific recommendations for stat optimization
- **Multi-Profession Support**: Optimization targets for Rifleman, Medic, Pistoleer, Artisan, Scout
