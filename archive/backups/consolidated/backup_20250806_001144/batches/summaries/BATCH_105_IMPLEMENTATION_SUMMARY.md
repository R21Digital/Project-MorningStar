# Batch 105 - Build Optimizer Tool Implementation Summary

## Overview

Batch 105 implements a comprehensive Build Optimizer Tool that provides AI-generated recommendations for character builds based on input stats. The system analyzes character statistics and provides recommendations for professions, buffs, food, armor, weapons, and stat reallocations.

## Key Features

### 1. Character Statistics Analysis
- **Primary Stats**: Health, Action, Mind
- **Secondary Stats**: Strength, Constitution, Agility, Quickness, Stamina, Presence, Focus, Willpower
- **Combat Roles**: DPS, Tank, Support, Hybrid, PVP, PVE
- **Context**: Level, Current Profession, Respec Availability

### 2. AI-Generated Recommendations
- **Profession Recommendations**: Based on stat distribution and combat role
- **Buff & Food Recommendations**: Optimized for combat role and stat deficiencies
- **Equipment Recommendations**: Armor and weapons tailored to combat role
- **Stat Reallocation**: Suggestions when respec is available

### 3. Scoring System
- **Overall Build Score**: 0-100% based on optimization potential
- **Individual Recommendation Scores**: Confidence levels for each suggestion
- **Combat Role Alignment**: How well stats align with chosen role

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Structures (`core/build_optimizer.py`)

**CharacterStats Dataclass:**
```python
@dataclass
class CharacterStats:
    # Primary stats
    health: int = 0
    action: int = 0
    mind: int = 0
    
    # Secondary stats
    strength: int = 0
    constitution: int = 0
    agility: int = 0
    quickness: int = 0
    stamina: int = 0
    presence: int = 0
    focus: int = 0
    willpower: int = 0
    
    # Combat role and context
    combat_role: CombatRole = CombatRole.DPS
    level: int = 1
    current_profession: Optional[str] = None
    respec_available: bool = False
```

**BuildRecommendation Dataclass:**
```python
@dataclass
class BuildRecommendation:
    recommendation_type: RecommendationType
    name: str
    description: str
    score: float
    reasoning: str
    requirements: List[str] = None
    benefits: List[str] = None
    drawbacks: List[str] = None
    cost: Optional[int] = None
    location: Optional[str] = None
```

**BuildAnalysis Dataclass:**
```python
@dataclass
class BuildAnalysis:
    character_stats: CharacterStats
    recommendations: List[BuildRecommendation]
    total_score: float
    analysis_date: datetime
    summary: str
```

#### 2. Build Optimizer Engine

**Profession Requirements:**
- Rifleman: Long-range combat specialist
- Pistoleer: High mobility close-range specialist
- Commando: Heavy weapons specialist
- Medic: Healing and support specialist
- Smuggler: Versatile combat and utility specialist
- Bounty Hunter: Bounty hunting and tracking specialist

**Combat Role Optimization:**
- DPS: High damage output focus
- Tank: Maximum protection and survivability
- Support: Healing and utility optimization
- Hybrid: Balanced combat and utility
- PVP: Player vs player optimization
- PVE: Player vs environment optimization

#### 3. Recommendation Algorithms

**Profession Scoring:**
```python
def _calculate_profession_score(self, stats: CharacterStats, requirements: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
    score = 0.0
    total_weight = 0.0
    
    # Check primary stats (weighted 2.0)
    for stat_name in requirements["primary_stats"]:
        stat_value = getattr(stats, stat_name, 0)
        weight = 2.0
        score += (stat_value / 100.0) * weight
        total_weight += weight
    
    # Check secondary stats (weighted 1.0)
    for stat_name in requirements["secondary_stats"]:
        stat_value = getattr(stats, stat_name, 0)
        weight = 1.0
        score += (stat_value / 100.0) * weight
        total_weight += weight
    
    # Combat role compatibility bonus
    if stats.combat_role in requirements["combat_roles"]:
        score += 0.3
        total_weight += 0.3
    
    return score / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else 0.0
```

**Equipment Recommendations:**
- Armor: Based on combat role and constitution
- Weapons: Based on combat role and action/strength stats
- Buffs: Role-specific buff recommendations
- Food: Sustained benefit recommendations

### 4. Web Interface (`dashboard/templates/build_optimizer.html`)

- Interactive character stats input form
- Real-time stats summary
- Build analysis results with scoring
- Categorized recommendations (Professions, Equipment, Buffs & Food)

### Basic Usage

```python
from core.build_optimizer import analyze_character_build, CharacterStats, CombatRole

# Create character stats
stats = CharacterStats(
    health=150,
    action=120,
    mind=80,
    strength=60,
    constitution=40,
    agility=50,
    quickness=45,
    stamina=35,
    presence=25,
    focus=30,
    willpower=25,
    combat_role=CombatRole.DPS,
    level=20,
    current_profession="rifleman",
    respec_available=False
)

# Analyze the build
analysis = analyze_character_build(stats)

# Access results
print(f"Build Score: {analysis.total_score * 100:.1f}%")
print(f"Summary: {analysis.summary}")

# Get recommendations by type
profession_recs = [r for r in analysis.recommendations if r.recommendation_type.value == 'profession']
equipment_recs = [r for r in analysis.recommendations if r.recommendation_type.value in ['armor', 'weapon']]

for rec in profession_recs:
    print(f"- {rec.name}: {rec.score * 100:.1f}%")
```

### Web Interface Usage

1. Navigate to `/tools/build-optimizer`
2. Enter character statistics
3. Select combat role and context
4. Click "Analyze Build"
5. Review recommendations and scores
6. Save build for later reference

## Configuration

### Data Files

The system uses existing data files:
- `data/profession_ranges.yaml`: Profession stat requirements
- `data/buff_icon_map.yaml`: Buff and food data
- `data/items.json`: Equipment data

### Optimizer Configuration

```python
# Profession requirements
profession_requirements = {
    "rifleman": {
        "primary_stats": ["action", "health"],
        "secondary_stats": ["strength", "constitution"],
        "combat_roles": [CombatRole.DPS, CombatRole.PVE],
        "weapon_preferences": ["rifle", "carbine", "pistol"],
        "description": "Long-range combat specialist with high accuracy"
    }
    # ... other professions
}

# Buff recommendations by combat role
buff_recommendations = {
    "dps": ["weapon_buff", "enhanced_weapon", "speed_buff"],
    "tank": ["armor_buff", "enhanced_armor", "healing"],
    # ... other roles
}
```
