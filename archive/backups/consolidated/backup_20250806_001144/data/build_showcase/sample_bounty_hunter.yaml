combat_notes: |
  This build is designed for PvP combat and bounty hunting missions.
  The combination of stealth, tracking, and high burst damage makes it deadly in 1v1 situations.
  
  Key strategies:
  - Use stealth to approach targets undetected
  - Track targets for damage bonuses and location awareness
  - Maintain distance when possible, use melee only when necessary
  - Save escape ability for emergency situations
  - Use adrenaline rush for burst damage windows
  
  Recommended for experienced players who enjoy tactical PvP combat.
