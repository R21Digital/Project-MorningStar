# Contributing to Project MorningStar

Thank you for considering contributing to Project MorningStar! This guide will help you understand our development process and how to contribute effectively.

## üéØ Project Overview

Project MorningStar consists of two main components:
- **SWGDB**: Public web database and tools for SWG players
- **MS11**: Advanced automation bot for long-session gameplay

## üìã Batch System Development

### What is the Batch System?

Project MorningStar uses a **batch-based development system** for organized feature implementation. Each batch represents a complete feature or enhancement with:

- **Implementation**: Core functionality and logic
- **Demo Scripts**: Showcase and testing scripts  
- **Test Suites**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Detailed implementation summaries

### Batch Structure

```
BATCH_XXX_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md  # Implementation documentation
demo_batch_XXX_feature.py            # Demo script
test_batch_XXX_feature.py            # Test suite
```

### Batch Development Process

1. **Create Batch Files**:
   ```bash
   # Implementation
   touch core/feature/your_feature.py
   
   # Demo script
   touch demo_batch_XXX_your_feature.py
   
   # Test suite
   touch test_batch_XXX_your_feature.py
   
   # Documentation
   touch BATCH_XXX_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
   ```

2. **Implement Feature**: Core functionality with proper error handling
3. **Create Demo**: Showcase script demonstrating the feature
4. **Write Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
5. **Document**: Detailed implementation summary
6. **Submit**: Pull request with all components

### Batch Naming Convention

- **Implementation**: `core/feature/feature_name.py`
- **Demo**: `demo_batch_XXX_feature_name.py`
- **Test**: `test_batch_XXX_feature_name.py`
- **Documentation**: `BATCH_XXX_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

Where `XXX` is the next available batch number.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Setup

## üìù Development Standards

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Documentation**: Use docstrings for all functions and classes
- **Type Hints**: Include type hints for function parameters and return values
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use snake_case for Python files
- **Functions**: Use snake_case for function names
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase for class names
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- **Variables**: Use snake_case for variable names

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle errors gracefully with fallbacks
- **Logging**: Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear error messages to users
- **Recovery**: Implement automatic recovery where possible

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test feature integration
- **Demo Scripts**: End-to-end functionality demonstration
- **Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ test coverage

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest test_batch_XXX_feature.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=core --cov-report=html

# Run demo scripts
python demo_batch_XXX_feature.py

# Run validation
make validate
```

### Test Structure

```python
# Example test structure
def test_feature_functionality():
    """Test the main functionality of the feature."""
    # Arrange
    input_data = "test_input"
    
    # Act
    result = feature_function(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == "expected_output"

def test_feature_error_handling():
    """Test error handling for the feature."""
    # Arrange
    invalid_input = None
    
    # Act & Assert
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        feature_function(invalid_input)
```

### Demo Scripts

Demo scripts should:
- Demonstrate the feature in action
- Include realistic usage examples
- Show error handling and recovery
- Provide clear output and feedback

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Implementation Summaries

Each batch should include a comprehensive implementation summary:

```markdown
# Batch XXX - Feature Name

## Overview
Brief description of the feature and its purpose.

## Implementation Details
- Core functionality implemented
- Key algorithms and logic
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance considerations

## Usage Examples
```python
# Example usage code
feature = FeatureClass()
result = feature.process_data(input_data)
```

## Testing
- Unit tests covering all functionality
- Integration tests for feature interaction
- Demo script for end-to-end testing

## Configuration
Required configuration options and their defaults.

## Dependencies
Any new dependencies added or modified.
```
