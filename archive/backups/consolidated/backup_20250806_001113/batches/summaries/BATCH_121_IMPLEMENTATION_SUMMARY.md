# Batch 121 – Mount Scanner + Speed Prioritizer
## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented an advanced mount scanning and speed prioritization system that automatically detects available mounts, ranks them by speed tiers, and selects the optimal mount based on user preferences and situational requirements.

### Goals Achieved ✅

#### 1. OCR and Macro Scan /learn_mounts Output
- **Command Output Parsing**: Comprehensive parsing of `/learn_mounts` command output with regex patterns
- **OCR Interface Scanning**: Screen capture and text extraction for mount detection
- **Hotbar Analysis**: Scanning of hotbar slots for mount icons and availability
- **Multi-Method Detection**: Combines command output, OCR, and hotbar scanning for comprehensive coverage
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for each scanning method with fallback options

#### 2. Rank Mounts by Known Speed Tiers
- **Speed Tier Classification**: Automatic classification into SLOW (5-8), MEDIUM (9-15), FAST (16-25), VERY_FAST (26+) tiers
- **Speed-Based Ranking**: Intelligent ranking system that prioritizes speed tiers and actual speed values
- **Mount Type Recognition**: Automatic classification of mounts as speeder, creature, vehicle, or flying types
- **Availability Detection**: Real-time detection of mount availability and cooldown status
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient caching system to minimize repeated scans

#### 3. User Mount Priority Specification
- **Preference-Based Selection**: User-defined preferred mounts with priority ordering
- **Situational Preferences**: Different mount preferences for combat, travel, hunting, city, and general situations
- **Banned Mounts**: Ability to blacklist specific mounts that should never be used
- **Mount Type Preferences**: Preference for specific mount types (speeder, creature, vehicle, flying)
- **Dynamic Preference Updates**: Real-time preference updates without restart

#### 4. Fallback to Fastest Available Mount
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Automatic fallback to fastest available mount when preferred mounts are unavailable
- **Situational Fallback**: Different fallback strategies for different situations
- **Availability Checking**: Ensures selected mounts are actually available and not on cooldown
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks mount usage and performance for optimization
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling when no mounts are available
