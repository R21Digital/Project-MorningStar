# MS11 Batch 090 – Public Player Profiles + Manual Upload System

## Implementation Summary

### Overview
Batch 090 implements a comprehensive public player profile system that allows real players to create character profiles and manually upload data to SWGDB. The system provides strict separation between public user data and internal bot data, ensuring security and data integrity.

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Public Player Profile Management

- **Profile Validation**: Input validation for servers, races, and professions
- **Profile Updates**: Ability to update existing profiles with new information
- **Profile Verification**: Admin verification system for profile authenticity

#### 2. Security & Data Separation
- **Public Data Directory**: `data/public_profiles/` for user-uploaded content
- **Internal Data Directory**: `data/internal/` for bot data (separate from public)
- **Upload Directory**: `data/uploads/` for temporary file processing
- **No Bot Data Exposure**: Strict separation ensures no internal bot data is exposed

#### 3. Web Interface
- **Profile Creation Page**: `/profile/create` with comprehensive form
- **Profile Display**: Rich profile pages showing all public stats
- **Navigation Integration**: Updated existing player pages with profile links
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with modern styling

#### 4. API Endpoints
