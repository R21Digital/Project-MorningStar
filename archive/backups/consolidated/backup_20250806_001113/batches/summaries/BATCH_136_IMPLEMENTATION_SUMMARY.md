# Batch 136 - Build Showcase & Rotation Library Implementation Summary

## Overview

Batch 136 implements a comprehensive structured system for showcasing popular character builds and rotations publicly. The system provides build profiles with profession trees, stat priorities, equipment recommendations, and sample DPS rotations or macros in YAML/Markdown format.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Build Profile System
- **Complete build profiles** with profession trees, stat priorities, weapons & armor, buffs & tapes
- **YAML/Markdown content format** for easy editing and version control
- **Tags system** for categorization (PvE, PvP, Solo, Group, BH, Medic, etc.)
- **Performance metrics** and combat notes for each build

### 2. Public Build Showcase
- **Public side**: `/builds/{profession}/{build-name}` URL structure
- **Search and filtering** by category, difficulty, profession, tags
- **Build browsing** with detailed view and export capabilities
- **Community features** including likes, comments, and view tracking

### 3. Admin Upload Tool
- **Admin interface** at `/build-showcase-admin` for managing featured builds
- **Build creation and editing** with JSON validation
- **User submission moderation** with draft status and approval workflow
- **Statistics dashboard** showing build performance metrics

### 4. User Submission System
- **User-submitted builds** flagged for moderation
- **Submission workflow** with draft → review → published status
- **Quality control** through admin approval process
