## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Data Structures**
```python
@dataclass
class SmartGoal:
    id: str
    title: str
    description: Optional[str]
    goal_type: GoalType
    category: GoalCategory
    status: GoalStatus
    priority: GoalPriority
    location: Optional[GoalLocation]
    prerequisites: List[GoalPrerequisite]
    rewards: List[GoalReward]
    progress_current: int
    progress_total: int
    progress_percentage: float
    # ... additional fields
```

### **Key Algorithms**

#### **Smart Suggestion Algorithm**
1. **Filter Available Goals**: Only goals with prerequisites met
2. **Calculate Priority Score**: 
   - Base priority score (1.0-4.0)
   - Location convenience bonus (+1.0 if nearby)
   - Time efficiency bonus (+0.5 if <30 minutes)
   - Reward value bonus (+0.2 per guaranteed reward)
3. **Sort by Priority Score**: Highest scores first
4. **Generate Reasons**: Human-readable explanation for each suggestion

#### **Completion Scoring Algorithm**
1. **Category Grouping**: Group goals by category
2. **Completion Calculation**: (completed_goals / total_goals) * 100
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Automatic recalculation on goal completion
4. **Planet-Specific Tracking**: Separate completion tracking per planet

#### **Prerequisite Checking Algorithm**
1. **Dependency Graph**: Build prerequisite relationships
2. **Status Verification**: Check if prerequisite goals are completed
3. **Optional Prerequisites**: Handle optional vs required prerequisites
4. **Path Calculation**: Determine complete prerequisite chain

### **Integration Points**
- **Collection Tracker**: Integration with existing collection system
- **Quest State**: Integration with quest progress tracking
- **Navigation System**: Location-based suggestion integration
- **Session AI**: Foundation for AI-driven goal selection

## üìä Usage Examples

### **Basic Goal Creation**
```python
from core.todo_tracker import SmartGoal, GoalType, GoalCategory, GoalPriority, GoalLocation

# Create a quest goal
goal = SmartGoal(
    id="legacy_quest_001",
    title="Legacy Quest: The Beginning",
    description="Start your journey with the Legacy quest line",
    goal_type=GoalType.QUEST,
    category=GoalCategory.MAIN_QUEST,
    priority=GoalPriority.HIGH,
    location=GoalLocation(planet="tatooine", city="mos_eisley"),
    estimated_time=30
)

# Add to tracker
goal_id = add_goal(goal)
```

### **Smart Suggestions**
```python
from core.todo_tracker import get_smart_suggestions

# Get suggestions for current location
suggestions = get_smart_suggestions(("tatooine", "mos_eisley"), max_suggestions=5)

for suggestion in suggestions:
    print(f"Goal: {suggestion.goal_id}")
    print(f"Reason: {suggestion.reason}")
    print(f"Priority Score: {suggestion.priority_score}")
```

### **Progress Tracking**
```python
from core.todo_tracker import update_goal_progress, complete_goal

# Update progress
update_goal_progress("legacy_quest_001", 2, 5)  # 40% complete

# Complete goal
complete_goal("legacy_quest_001")
```

### **Analytics and Statistics**
```python
from core.todo_tracker import get_statistics, get_completion_scores

# Get overall statistics
stats = get_statistics()
print(f"Overall completion: {stats['overall_completion_percentage']:.1f}%")

# Get category completion scores
scores = get_completion_scores()
for category, score in scores.items():
