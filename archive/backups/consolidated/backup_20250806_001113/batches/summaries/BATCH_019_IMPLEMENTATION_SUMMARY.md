# Batch 019 ‚Äì Special Goals + Unlock Paths Implementation Summary

## Overview

Batch 019 implements a comprehensive special goals system that supports long-term achievement goals such as house deeds, rare loot, third character slot unlock, and other unlockable content. The system provides goal prioritization, milestone tracking, and dashboard integration.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Implemented `profiles/special_goals.py`

**File:** `profiles/special_goals.py`

**Features:**
- **Goal Management**: High-level management of special goals with prioritization and selection
- **Milestone Tracking**: Progress monitoring with detailed milestone tracking
- **Dashboard Integration**: Goal display and status tracking
- **Active Goal Management**: Session-based goal management and scheduling

**Key Classes:**
- `GoalMilestone`: Represents individual milestones within goals
- `ActiveGoalSession`: Tracks active goal sessions with progress
- `SpecialGoalsManager`: Main manager class for goal operations

**Core Functions:**
- `get_prioritized_goals()`: Returns goals prioritized by importance and readiness
- `start_goal_session()`: Begins working on a specific goal
- `get_current_goal_status()`: Returns detailed status of active goal
- `update_milestone_progress()`: Updates progress for specific milestones
- `get_dashboard_data()`: Generates data for dashboard display

### 2. Goal Loading from `data/goals.json`

**File:** `data/goals.json` (already existed)

**Features:**
- **10 Pre-defined Goals**: Including character slot unlocks, key quests, token loops
