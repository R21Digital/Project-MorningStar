    name: str
    email: str
    category: str
    priority: str
    subject: str
    message: str
    status: str
    created_at: str
    updated_at: str
    assigned_to: Optional[str] = None
    response: Optional[str] = None
    resolved_at: Optional[str] = None
```

**TicketResponse:**
```python
@dataclass
class TicketResponse:
    success: bool
    ticket_id: Optional[str] = None
    category: Optional[str] = None
    priority: Optional[str] = None
    error: Optional[str] = None
    message: Optional[str] = None
```

### API Endpoints

**POST /api/tickets/submit**
- Accepts JSON ticket data
- Returns success/error response with ticket details
- Status codes: 201 (success), 400 (validation error), 500 (server error)

**GET /api/tickets/stats**
- Returns ticket statistics
- Includes category and priority breakdowns
- Status code: 200 (success)

### Configuration Files

**Email Configuration (`config/email_config.json`):**
```json
{
  "smtp_server": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "smtp_port": 587,
  "username": "support@ms11.com",
  "password": "app_password",
  "from_email": "noreply@ms11.com",
  "admin_email": "admin@ms11.com",
  "use_tls": true
}
```

**Discord Configuration (`config/discord_config.json`):**
```json
{
  "support_webhook_url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...",
  "discord_token": "bot_token",
  "support_channel_id": 123456789
}
```
