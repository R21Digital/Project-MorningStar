## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Goal Management System
```python
# Load and manage goals
goals_system = get_special_goals()
available_goals = goals_system.get_available_goals()

# Start and work on goals
success = start_special_goal("Third Character Slot Unlock")
progress_made = work_on_current_goal()
```

### 2. Requirement Checking
```python
# Check goal requirements
requirements_check = goals_system.check_goal_requirements("Mustafar Key Quest")
if requirements_check['all_requirements_met']:
    print("All requirements met!")
else:
    print("Requirements not met:")
    for req in requirements_check['requirements']:
        if not req['met']:
            print(f"  - {req['requirement']}")
```

### 3. Priority-Based Goal Selection
```python
# Get goals by priority
critical_goals = get_available_goals(priority=GoalPriority.CRITICAL)
high_priority_goals = get_available_goals(priority=GoalPriority.HIGH)

# Goals are automatically sorted by priority (critical first)
```

### 4. Navigation Integration
```python
# Travel to goal location
navigator = get_navigator()
travel_automation = get_travel_automation()

# Try travel automation first, fallback to direct navigation
success = travel_automation.travel_to_unlock(f"{goal.planet}_{goal.zone}_access")
if not success:
    waypoint = f"{goal.planet}/{goal.zone}/{goal.coordinates[0]},{goal.coordinates[1]}"
    success = navigator.navigate_to_waypoint(waypoint)
```

### 5. Dialogue Interaction
```python
# Interact with goal
dialogue_detector = get_dialogue_detector()
dialogue_window = dialogue_detector.wait_for_dialogue(timeout=5.0)

if dialogue_window:
    # Look for goal-related dialogue options
    for i, option in enumerate(dialogue_window.options, 1):
        if any(keyword in option.lower() for keyword in 
              ["accept", "start", "begin", "proceed", "continue", "unlock"]):
            dialogue_detector.click_dialogue_option(i)
            return True
```

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Run special goals mode
python src/main.py --mode special-goals

# Run with profile
python src/main.py --mode special-goals --profile questing

# Run with smart mode switching
python src/main.py --mode special-goals --smart
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from core.special_goals import (
    get_special_goals, start_special_goal, work_on_current_goal,
    get_special_goals_status, list_special_goals, get_available_goals
)

# Get the system
goals_system = get_special_goals()

# Check status
status = get_special_goals_status()
print(f"Active goals: {status['active_goals']}")

# Start a goal
available = get_available_goals()
if available:
    success = start_special_goal(available[0].name)
    if success:
        # Work on the goal
        work_on_current_goal()
```
