# Batch 043 – NPC Quest Signal + Smart Detection Logic

## Overview

Batch 043 implements a comprehensive NPC quest signal detection system that enables the bot to visually detect quest-giving NPCs based on in-game visual markers and match them with the imported quest database from Batch 042. The system provides intelligent quest acquisition logic and logs unmatched NPCs for future training.

## Goals Achieved

✅ **Implement OCR/image detection for quest icons above NPCs**
- Computer vision-based quest icon detection using OpenCV
- Support for multiple quest icon types (quest, repeatable, daily, weekly)
- Color-based detection with confidence scoring
- Configurable detection regions and thresholds

✅ **Scan and log nearby NPC names with quest icons**
- OCR-based NPC name extraction from screen regions
- Intelligent text cleaning and validation
- Coordinate mapping for NPC positions
- Confidence scoring for detection accuracy

✅ **Match detected names with quests in local database**
- Multiple matching strategies (exact, fuzzy, partial, alias)
- Integration with quest database from Batch 042
- NPC name variations and aliases support
- Confidence-based match ranking

✅ **If match found, trigger smart quest acquisition logic**
- Automatic acquisition for high-confidence matches
- Suggested acquisition for medium-confidence matches
- Manual acquisition for low-confidence matches
- Prerequisite and level requirement checking

✅ **Log new/unmatched NPCs for future training**
- Persistent storage of unmatched NPCs
- Context information for training data
- Acquisition attempt logging
- Statistics and performance monitoring
