travel_notes: |
  The entrance to Axkva Min's complex is located in the southeastern ruins of Dantooine. 
  Look for the large stone archway marked with ancient Jedi symbols. The instance entrance 
  is at the bottom of the staircase leading underground. Groups should meet at the nearby 
  camp for final preparations.
