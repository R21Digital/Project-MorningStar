# Batch 115 – Environmental Awareness & Risk Avoidance Implementation Summary

## Overview

**Batch 115** implements a comprehensive environmental awareness and risk avoidance system that equips the bot with better situational logic for detecting and avoiding environmental threats. The system provides real-time threat detection, risk assessment, and automated avoidance strategies to enhance bot safety and reduce detection risk.

## Goals Achieved

✅ **Detect**: Hostile NPC clusters, High GCW zones, AFK reporting hotspots  
✅ **Avoid**: Spamming skills near starports, Staying still in crowded zones, Returning to death locations  
✅ **Optional**: Risk zone mapping with player reports and avoidance strategies  

## Core Features

### 1. Threat Detection System
- **Hostile NPC Clusters**: Detects groups of hostile NPCs using OCR text analysis
- **High GCW Zones**: Identifies high-risk Galactic Civil War zones
- **AFK Reporting Hotspots**: Detects crowded areas with potential AFK reporting risk
- **Starport Proximity**: Monitors distance to starports to avoid AFK reporting
- **Player Clusters**: Detects groups of players that may pose reporting risk
- **Death Locations**: Tracks and avoids areas where the bot previously died

### 2. Risk Assessment Engine
- **Multi-level Risk Classification**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL risk levels
- **Real-time Threat Analysis**: Continuous monitoring and assessment
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each threat detection includes confidence metrics
- **Risk Level Calculation**: Automatic risk level determination based on detected threats

### 3. Avoidance Strategies
- **Move to Safe Zone**: Navigate to predefined safe areas
- **Change Zone**: Travel to different zones when in high-risk areas
- **Random Movement**: Perform random movements to avoid detection
- **Reduce Activity**: Decrease bot activity when near starports
- **Move to Less Crowded**: Relocate to less populated areas
- **Avoid Area**: Steer clear of specific dangerous locations

### 4. Environmental Monitoring
- **Continuous Scanning**: Background monitoring with configurable intervals
- **Location Tracking**: Real-time position and zone monitoring
- **Movement History**: Track movement patterns for analysis
- **Death Location Memory**: Remember and avoid previous death locations
