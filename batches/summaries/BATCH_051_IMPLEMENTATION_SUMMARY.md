# MS11 Batch 051 – Lightweight AI Task Planner (BabyAGI-Inspired)

## Overview

Batch 051 introduces a modular agent system inspired by BabyAGI to allow the MS11 bot to schedule and prioritize tasks (questing, traveling, healing, etc.) dynamically, including future long-term goals. The system maintains a task queue with priority sorting and completed task memory, integrating with the session manager to dynamically assign goals per session.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Core Task Planner (`core/planner.py`)

**Task Data Structures:**
- `Task` dataclass with comprehensive fields: id, priority, type, description, requirements, status
- `TaskType` enum covering all major activities: QUEST, TRAVEL, COMBAT, HEALING, CRAFTING, TRAINING, COLLECTION, SOCIAL, EXPLORATION, MAINTENANCE, EMERGENCY
- `TaskStatus` enum for lifecycle management: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED, BLOCKED
- `TaskPriority` enum with 5 levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, BACKGROUND
- `TaskRequirement` for dependency management
- `TaskResult` for execution outcomes

**TaskPlanner Class:**
- Priority queue with intelligent task ordering
- Session integration for goal-based planning
- Performance metrics tracking
- Data persistence with JSON storage
- Task lifecycle management (add, start, complete, fail, cancel)
- Dependency resolution and validation
- Replanning capabilities based on changing conditions

### 2. Task Queue Management

**Priority-Based Execution:**
- Tasks are ordered by priority (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW → BACKGROUND)
- Within same priority, tasks are ordered by creation time (FIFO)
- Dependencies are automatically checked before task execution
- Blocked tasks are skipped until dependencies are met

**Queue Operations:**
- `add_task()`: Add new task with validation
- `get_next_task()`: Get highest priority available task
- `start_task()`: Mark task as in progress
- `complete_task()`: Mark task as completed with results
- `fail_task()`: Mark task as failed with error details
- `cancel_task()`: Cancel task with reason

### 3. Session Integration

**Dynamic Goal Assignment:**
- `set_session()`: Associate planner with current session
- Session goals drive task generation
- Replanning based on session objectives
- Task results linked to session for analytics

**Goal-Based Task Generation:**
- Automatic task creation from session goals
- Location-aware task planning
- Requirement validation against current state
- Adaptive task prioritization

### 4. Performance Tracking

**Comprehensive Metrics:**
- Success rate by task type
- Average execution duration
- XP and credits gained per task type
- Total tasks completed
- Error patterns and failure analysis

**Historical Data:**
- Task execution history
- Performance trends over time
- Learning from past successes/failures
- Session-based analytics

### 5. Data Persistence

**JSON Storage:**
- Active tasks saved to `data/task_planner.json`
- Completed tasks with results
- Performance metrics history
- Session data and goals
- Automatic data loading on startup

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful handling of corrupted data files
- Default values for missing data
- Logging of data operations
- Backup and recovery mechanisms

## Implementation Details

### Task Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Task created with requirements and dependencies
2. **Validation**: Requirements checked against current game state
3. **Queueing**: Task added to priority queue
4. **Selection**: Highest priority available task selected
5. **Execution**: Task marked as in progress and executed
6. **Completion**: Task results recorded and metrics updated
7. **Cleanup**: Task moved to completed tasks, new tasks generated

### Priority System

```python
class TaskPriority(Enum):
    CRITICAL = 0  # Emergency tasks (healing, escaping)
    HIGH = 1      # Important tasks (main quests, combat)
    MEDIUM = 2    # Regular tasks (side quests, training)
    LOW = 3       # Optional tasks (collections, exploration)
    BACKGROUND = 4  # Background tasks (maintenance, monitoring)
```

### Dependency Resolution

- Tasks with unmet dependencies are blocked
- Dependencies can be other tasks or game state requirements
- Automatic dependency checking before task execution
- Circular dependency detection and prevention

### Replanning Logic

1. **State Assessment**: Current location and goals evaluated
2. **Requirement Update**: Task requirements updated based on current state
3. **Queue Rebuild**: Priority queue rebuilt with updated tasks
4. **Goal Analysis**: Session goals analyzed for new task generation
5. **Task Creation**: New tasks created from goals and current state

## Integration Points

### Session Manager Integration
- Tasks linked to session IDs for tracking
- Session goals drive task generation
- Task results contribute to session analytics
- Automatic session-based replanning

### Todo Tracker Integration
- Goals from todo tracker converted to tasks
- Task completion updates goal progress
- Smart suggestions integrated with task planning
- Collection and quest tracking alignment

### Memory System Integration
- Task execution events logged to session memory
- Performance data contributes to learning patterns
- Historical task data for decision making
- Memory-based task prioritization

## Usage Examples

### Basic Task Management

```python
from core.planner import Task, TaskType, TaskPriority, add_task, get_next_task

# Create a quest task
quest_task = Task(
    id="quest_main_001",
    type=TaskType.QUEST,
    title="Complete Main Quest",
    description="Complete the main storyline quest",
    priority=TaskPriority.HIGH,
    location="Naboo"
)

# Add to planner
task_id = add_task(quest_task)

# Get next task to execute
next_task = get_next_task()
```

### Session-Based Planning

```python
from core.planner import set_session, replan

# Set up session with goals
set_session("session_001", ["goal_quest_main", "goal_combat_training"])

# Replan based on current state
new_tasks = replan(current_location="Naboo", current_goals=["goal_quest_main"])
```

### Task Execution

```python
from core.planner import complete_task, TaskResult

# Execute task and record results
result = TaskResult(
    success=True,
    duration=300,  # 5 minutes
    xp_gained=500,
    credits_gained=1000,
    items_gained=["Quest Reward"]
)

complete_task("quest_main_001", result)
```
