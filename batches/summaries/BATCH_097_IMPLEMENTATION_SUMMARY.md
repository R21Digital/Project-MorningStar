- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Clear hierarchy between accounts and characters
- **Account Statistics**: Aggregated statistics across all characters in an account

#### 2. Character Profile System
- **Detailed Character Data**: Name, server, race, profession, level, city, guild, faction

- **Notes and Customization**: Personal notes and custom data fields
- **Visibility Controls**: Public, private, or friends-only visibility settings

#### 3. Session History Tracking

- **Duration and Timing**: Session duration and timestamp tracking

#### 4. Main Character Designation
- **Primary Character**: Each account can designate one main character

- **Easy Switching**: Simple interface to change main character designation

#### 5. Visibility Controls
- **Public Profiles**: Fully visible to all users
- **Private Profiles**: Only visible to account owner
- **Friends-Only**: Visible to friends (future implementation)
- **Per-Character Control**: Individual visibility settings for each character
