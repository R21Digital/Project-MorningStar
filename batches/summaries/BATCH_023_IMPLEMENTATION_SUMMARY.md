# Batch 023 Implementation Summary
## Mount Detection and Automatic Mounting

### Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive mount detection and automatic mounting system that enables MS11 to automatically detect available mounts and use them for long-distance travel. The system includes intelligent mount detection, zone-based restrictions, fallback handling, and user-configurable preferences.

### Goals Achieved âœ…

1. **Mount Detection**: âœ… Detect learned mounts using `/mount` command results and hotbar scan
2. **Automatic Mounting**: âœ… Use mount when travel distance > 100m and not indoors/in combat
3. **Fallback Handling**: âœ… Add fallback if mounting fails (e.g., can't summon indoors)
4. **User Preferences**: âœ… Allow user to set preferred mount and configuration options
5. **Zone Restrictions**: âœ… Respect blacklisted zones and indoor/combat restrictions
6. **OCR Integration**: âœ… Use screen OCR for hotbar mount detection
7. **Test Mode**: âœ… Comprehensive test suite with test mode for faster execution

### Technical Implementation Details

#### **Mount Detection Architecture:**
```python
class MountManager:
    def detect_mounts(self) -> List[str]:
        # Method 1: /mount command output
        # Method 2: Hotbar scan (OCR)
        # Update learned status
        # Return detected mount names
```

#### **Mount Decision Logic:**
```python
def should_mount_for_travel(self, travel_distance: float, zone_name: str = None) -> bool:
    # Check auto-mount enabled
    # Check distance threshold
    # Check zone restrictions
    # Check indoor/combat restrictions
    # Check available mounts
```

#### **Best Mount Selection:**
```python
def get_best_mount(self, zone_name: str = None) -> Optional[str]:
    # Filter by learned status
    # Apply zone restrictions
    # Sort by preference then speed
    # Return best available mount
```

#### **Configuration Structure:**
```json
{
  "preferred_mount": "speederbike",
  "auto_mount_distance": 100,
  "blacklisted_zones": ["inside_building", "spaceport"],
  "enable_auto_mount": true,
  "enable_auto_dismount": true,
  "mount_detection_methods": ["hotbar_scan", "command_output"],
  "fallback_mounts": ["dewback", "speeder"],
  "combat_mount_allowed": false,
  "indoor_mount_allowed": false,
  "city_mount_allowed": true
}
```

from movement.mount_manager import (
    detect_mounts, auto_mount_for_travel, 
    update_zone_info, get_mount_status
)

# Detect mounts
mounts = detect_mounts()

# Auto mount
success = auto_mount_for_travel(200)
