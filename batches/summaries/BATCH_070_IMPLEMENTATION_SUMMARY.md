  - Tactical recommendations based on build type
  - Distance and positioning advice

#### User Confirmation Workflow
- Interactive confirmation prompts
- Options to apply, save, or cancel build changes
- Logging of user decisions for audit purposes

### 3. Enhanced Build-Aware Behavior System

**File: `core/build_aware_behavior.py`**

#### Integration with Confirmation System
- New `load_build_from_link_with_confirmation()` method
- Automatic build application with user confirmation
- Support for auto-confirmation mode for automated workflows

#### Improved Build Application
- Centralized `_apply_build()` method for consistent build application
- Enhanced combat behavior adaptation
- Better integration with combat engine

#### Detailed Reporting
- New `get_detailed_report()` method for comprehensive build analysis
- Integration with confirmation system for detailed reports

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Profession Mappings

The system now includes detailed mappings for 12 professions:

```python
profession_skills = {
    "rifleman": {
        "weapons": ["rifle", "carbine"],
        "abilities": ["Rifle Shot", "Rifle Hit", "Rifle Critical Hit", ...],
        "combat_style": "ranged",
        "min_distance": 5
    },
    "medic": {
        "weapons": ["pistol", "rifle"],
        "abilities": ["Heal", "Cure Poison", "Cure Disease", ...],
        "combat_style": "support",
        "min_distance": 3
    },
    # ... additional professions
}
```

### URL Parsing Enhancements

Improved parsing handles various URL formats:

```python
# Basic format
"https://swgr.org/skill-calculator/rifleman"

# With skills
"https://swgr.org/skill-calculator/rifleman?skills=rifle_shot,marksman_shot"

# With professions
"https://swgr.org/skill-calculator/rifleman?skills=rifle_shot&professions=rifleman"

# With additional parameters
"https://swgr.org/skill-calculator/rifleman?skills=rifle_shot&build=test123&version=1.0"
```

### Build Confirmation Workflow

The confirmation system provides a complete user experience:

1. **Parse Build**: Extract information from SkillCalc link
2. **Display Summary**: Show formatted build information
3. **Get Confirmation**: Present options to user
4. **Apply/Save**: Execute user's choice
5. **Log Decision**: Record for audit purposes

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from core.build_aware_behavior import create_build_aware_behavior

# Create build-aware behavior system
build_aware = create_build_aware_behavior(combat_engine)

# Load build with user confirmation
build_data = build_aware.load_build_from_link_with_confirmation(
    "https://swgr.org/skill-calculator/rifleman?skills=rifle_shot,marksman_shot"
)
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from core.build_confirmation import create_build_confirmation

# Create confirmation system
confirmation = create_build_confirmation()

# Display build summary
summary = confirmation.display_build_summary(build_data)
print(summary)

# Generate detailed report
detailed_report = confirmation.generate_detailed_report(build_data)
print(f"Combat Style: {detailed_report['combat_analysis']['primary_style']}")
```
