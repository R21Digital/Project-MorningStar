**Purpose:** Foundational combat engine with intelligent attack execution

**Key Features:**
- **CombatEngine Class:** Main combat management system
- **Skill Scanning:** Scan available skills from hotbar or config/memory
- **Attack Sequence Building:** Build attack sequence based on active spec profile
- **Cooldown Tracking:** Track cooldowns and avoid spamming unavailable actions
- **Combat State Detection:** Detect combat state (enemy targeted, health bar present)
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Include fallback (auto-attack or default skill if no chain is defined)

**Data Structures:**
- `CombatState` enum: IDLE, IN_COMBAT, TARGETING, CASTING, COOLDOWN, DEAD, FLEEING
- `SkillPriority` enum: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, FALLBACK
- `DamageType` enum: KINETIC, ENERGY, HEAT, COLD, ELECTRICITY, ACID, STUN, HEAL
- `Skill` dataclass: Combat skill with properties (hotkey, cooldown, cast_time, damage_range, range, priority)
